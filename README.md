# Kelsie Review Block

A lightweight testimonials plugin that provides the **Review List** block with ACF-powered fields and Rank Math schema output. Content is managed directly in the block (or via ACF fields) without any custom post types.

## Installation
1. Copy this folder to `wp-content/plugins/kelsie-review-block` inside your WordPress installation.
2. Activate **Kelsie Review Block** from the Plugins screen.
3. (Optional) Activate ACF or ACF Pro to use the bundled reviewer name, role, and rating fields.

## Usage
- Add the **Review List** block to a page or template and fill in the testimonial fields.
- Use the block's ACF repeater to manage multiple testimonials within the same block instance.

The plugin also loads front-end and editor styles for the block and injects an ItemList schema via Rank Math based on the testimonials entered into the block.
